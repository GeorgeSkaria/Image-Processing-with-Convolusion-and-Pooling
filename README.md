# Image-Processing-with-Convolusion-and-Pooling
This repository contains a Python script that performs image processing using convolution and downsampling techniques. The script applies a custom convolutional filter to an input image, enhances the image details, and then performs downsampling to create a new image.  Prerequisites Python (3.6 or higher) NumPy SciPy OpenCV Matplotlib
