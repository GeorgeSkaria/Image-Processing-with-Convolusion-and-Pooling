# Image-Processing-with-Convolusion-and-Pooling
This repository contains a Python script that performs image processing using convolution and downsampling techniques. The script applies a custom convolutional filter to an input image, enhances the image details, and then performs downsampling to create a new image. 

## Prerequisites 
Python (3.6 or higher) 
NumPy
SciPy 
OpenCV
Matplotlib

## Customization
You can modify the convolutional filter, weight, and other parameters in the script to experiment with different image processing effects.
